				<h3>What is a world wide web?</h3>

				<div>The World Wide Web (www, W3) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URIs, interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. It has become known simply as the Web.The development of the World Wide Web was begun in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN, an international scientific organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. They created a protocol, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which standardized communication between servers and clients. Their text-based Web browser was made available for general release in January 1992.</div>

				<h3>How does it affect one?</h3>

				<div>How can we be the best for advance children’s rights in the digital age? The starting point must be children themselves – asking about the barriers they face in accessing the internet, the opportunities they are discovering online, the digital skills they are acquiring and the risks of harm that they face.
				<br>
				<br>
				Social media networking sites are seen as being very ‘cool’ by children and they may be pressured by their friends into joining them. As with most potential online dangers, the problems can start if the child doesn’t look after their personal information properly. The risks you need to be aware of are: cyberbullying (bullying using digital technology), invasion of privacy, identity theft, your child seeing offensive images and messages, the presence of strangers who may be there to ‘groom’ other members.The sites don’t actually present any threats that don’t already exist elsewhere online. The danger is that the threats exist in a new online environment you or your child may not be familiar with.As with most potential online dangers, the problems can start if the child doesn’t look after their personal information properly.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Global Kids Online network is committed to gathering the necessary evidence by listening to children and generating cross-nationally comparable and robust data that directly reflects children’s voices, experiences and concerns.</div>
