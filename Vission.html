			<h3>What is it's current situation?</h3>

			<p>Having access to the internet on smart devices led to the overuse of smart devices like laptops or smartphones/ tablets. You would be shocked to know the number of diseases reported among children globally. All this is a result of cutting off physical activities because of playing games or accessing the web or binge-watching for long hours. There is a huge rise in the number of patients with insomnia, depression, obesity, and eyesight among children.Millions of children are at increased risk of harm at a time in their lives when they are increasingly using the web due to confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF and its partners said today.The coronavirus pandemic has led to an unprecedented increase in screen time for children. â€œSchool closings and strict containment measures mean that more and more families are relying on technology and digital solutions for children to learn, be entertained and connect with the outside world; however, not all children have the knowledge, skills, and resources to stay safe online.</p>

			<h3>What is the conclusion for this?</h3>

			<p>No parent around the world would want their kids to absorb this kind of content. Especially after seeing the huge rise in the number of depression cases. Parents are quite limited in keeping an eye on the content their kids are absorbing on these platforms.On the very last World Mental Health Day, experts suggested taking a break from social media platforms as these are having a negative impact on mental health. We believe in living for today - and tomorrow! Because our decisions have a lasting impact, therfore we should make them thoughtfully. We should focus on nurturing our and  children's health and work for their better tomorrow.</p>
